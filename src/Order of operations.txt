Database creation:
1. historic_data_analyse.py - run Database.CreateNewDatabase(league)
2. whoscored_get_match_links.py - Download all the links for "whoscored" pages for a specific league.
3. whoscored_get_ratings.py - Download all the ratings to a separate file
4. whoscored_convert_data.py - Generate lines
5. whoscored_convert_data.py - Replace lines

6. historic_data_analyse - update the database and fixtures

7. If I wanted to add stats based on the whoscored ratings it would be like:
	-create database
	-add whoscored ratings to it
	-calculate overall ratings based on the last 5-20 games and add it to the table
Or change the scheme into:
	-download all the ratings first
	-create database with the ratings and do whatever I want with them (simpler solution)
